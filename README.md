# Receipt Automation with AWS

A fully serverless system for automated receipt data extraction and storage, built using AWS. Users can upload image or PDF receipts through a Streamlit interface, triggering a backend pipeline powered by AWS Lambda and Amazon Textract to extract structured fields. Parsed data is stored in DynamoDB, with presigned S3 URLs providing secure file access. Real-time email alerts are sent via SES. The architecture is IAM-secured, scalable, and designed for minimal operational overheadâ€”ideal for automating financial workflows such as expense tracking and invoice management.

## Architecture Overview

This project follows an event-driven, serverless architecture using AWS-native services:

## How It Works

1. **User Upload**: Users upload receipts (images or PDFs) via the Streamlit UI.
2. **Store in S3**: Files are saved to an S3 bucket under the `incoming/` path.
3. **Trigger Lambda**: An S3 event triggers a Lambda function for processing.
4. **Extract with Textract**: Lambda calls Textract to extract structured data like vendor, date, and total amount.
5. **Store in DynamoDB**: The parsed data is cleaned and inserted into a DynamoDB table.
6. **Send Email**: A summary email is sent to a predefined recipient via Amazon SES.
7. **Frontend Display**: Users can view processed receipts in the Streamlit UI, with direct access to files via presigned S3 URLs.
